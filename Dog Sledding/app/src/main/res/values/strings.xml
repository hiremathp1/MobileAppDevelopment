    <string name="txtdes">We run an awesome 6-mile tour along the gorgeous
        winding trails of the Swan River Valley. Each dog sled trip begins with our friendly,
        knowledgeable guides explaining how to run the sled and how to work with the beautiful
        Siberian Huskies on your team. The tour, which can handle up to 6 people, is run as
        a "relay" - guests will switch off between running the dogs, riding in the dogsled,
        and riding on a small passenger sleigh with the guide. </string>
